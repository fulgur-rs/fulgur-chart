# fulgur chart-server

> **⚠️ Experimental** — Not production-ready. APIs and behavior may change without notice.

HTTP rendering server that accepts Chart.js v4 JSON specs and returns SVG, PNG, WebP, or data-URI.

- **OpenAPI UI**: `/docs`
- **OpenAPI JSON**: `/openapi.json`
- **MCP endpoint**: `POST /mcp` (JSON-RPC 2.0, MCP 2025-03-26)

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo run -p chart-server
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chart \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"chart":{"type":"bar","data":{"labels":["A","B"],"datasets":[{"data":[1,2]}]}}}'
# → PNG binary (Content-Type: image/png)
```

}
```

## Output Formats

| Value | Content-Type | Description |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `png` | `image/png` | Binary PNG (default) |
| `svg` | `image/svg+xml` | Inline SVG |
| `webp` | `image/webp` | Binary WebP — **disabled by default** (opt-in, see below) |
| `data-uri` | `text/plain` | `data:image/svg+xml;base64,…` |

## PNG compression

PNG encode trades speed for file size. This is a **server-wide startup setting**
(`FULGUR_PNG_COMPRESSION` / `--png-compression`), not a per-request parameter —
the operator picks one preset for the deployment. WebP is lossless and SVG is text,
so the setting only affects PNG. All presets produce pixel-identical, deterministic output.

| Preset | Filter / deflate | Speed | Size |
|--------|------------------|-------|------|
| `fast` | Sub + fdeflate | fastest | largest |
| `balanced` (default) | adaptive + fdeflate | fast | small |
| `high` | adaptive + zlib L6 | slowest | smallest |

`balanced` keeps most of `fast`'s speed with a large size reduction; `high` minimizes
size further at a higher encode cost. Pixels are identical across all presets.

## WebP output (opt-in)

WebP lossless encoding holds up to **three** full-frame buffers at peak (the pixmap,
the encoder's mutable input copy, and the encoded VP8L chunk, each up to `area × 4`
bytes for poorly-compressible content). For an untrusted-input server this is an
OOM vector, so WebP is **disabled by default** and must be enabled with
`FULGUR_WEBP_ENABLED=true`. When enabled, `FULGUR_MAX_WEBP_AREA` caps the post-scale
pixel area (peak memory ≈ `area × 4 × 3`); lower it to fit a tight memory budget.
The default equals the library's hard limit, which the renderer also enforces.
With WebP disabled, `format=webp` returns `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | — | Port injected by Railway etc. (takes precedence over `FULGUR_PORT`) |
| `FULGUR_PORT` | `3000` | Bind port |
| `FULGUR_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `FULGUR_MAX_CONCURRENT` | CPU count | Maximum concurrent renders |
| `FULGUR_MAX_BODY_SIZE` | `102400` | Request body size limit (bytes) |
| `FULGUR_RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1000` | Render timeout (milliseconds) |
| `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_DIR` | `./fulgur-shortlinks` | Directory where short links are persisted (one file per link). Created on startup; the server fails fast if it can't be created. For persistence across redeploy this must live on durable storage — see [Short link persistence](#short-link-persistence) |
| `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_ENTRY_BYTES` | `524288` (512 KiB) | Per-entry byte cap for a stored short link. Oversized requests are rejected with `413 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`. The stored value is the URL-encoded chart JSON (up to ~3× the raw body), so keep this ≳ `3 × FULGUR_MAX_BODY_SIZE`; raising `FULGUR_MAX_BODY_SIZE` without raising this will 413 legitimate large charts |
| `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` (24h) | Guaranteed minimum resolvable lifetime for a short link, as a floor guarantee (the underlying data isn't necessarily deleted at exactly this time). Used as the `Cache-Control: max-age` on successful `/chart/s/{id}` resolutions so upstream CDNs don't serve stale resolutions past the guarantee window |
| `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_BYTES` | `536870912` (512 MiB) | Aggregate byte budget for the shortlink store (`0` = unlimited). The TTL sweep is the primary drain; this is a hard guard that caps disk even if the store is filled within the TTL window. An over-budget `POST /chart/create` triggers an inline sweep and, if still full, returns `503` (self-heals on the next sweep). Must be `≥ FULGUR_SHORTLINK_ENTRY_BYTES` or the server fails fast at startup |
| `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_ENTRIES` | `100000` | Maximum number of stored short links (`0` = unlimited); caps inode/directory growth. Same over-cap behaviour as `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_BYTES` (inline sweep → `503` if still full) |
| `FULGUR_CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | Allowed CORS origins (comma-separated) |
| `FULGUR_RATE_LIMIT` | `0` | Rate limit (requests/minute/IP). `0` disables rate limiting (default) |
| `FULGUR_PNG_COMPRESSION` | `balanced` | PNG compression preset: `fast` / `balanced` / `high` (PNG only) |
| `FULGUR_WEBP_ENABLED` | `false` | Allow `format=webp`. Off by default (WebP has a higher peak-memory cost; opt-in) |
| `FULGUR_MAX_WEBP_AREA` | library limit (~21.3M) | Max post-scale pixel area for WebP. Peak memory ≈ `area × 4 × 3`; lower to tighten |

## Docker

The Dockerfile expects a pre-built binary. Build from the repository root:

```bash
cargo build --release -p chart-server
cp target/release/chart-server chart-server-bin
docker build -f crates/chart-server/Dockerfile -t chart-server .
# mount a volume at /data so short links survive `docker restart` and redeploys
docker run -p 3000:3000 -v chart-shortlinks:/data chart-server
```

The image sets `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_DIR=/data` (a nonroot-owned directory baked into
the image), so it starts even without a volume — but short links are then lost on
redeploy. Mount a volume at `/data` (as above, or via the provided
`docker-compose.yml`) to persist them. See [Short link persistence](#short-link-persistence).

## Short link persistence

Short links (`POST /chart/create` → `GET /chart/s/{id}`) are stored on disk under
`FULGUR_SHORTLINK_DIR`, one file per link, and resolve across process restarts and
redeploys **as long as that directory is on durable storage**. This is single-node
durability: the directory is host/volume-local, so a multi-instance deployment behind
a load balancer only resolves links created on the same node (or on a shared network
volume). Horizontal scale-out is out of scope for this backend.

- **Docker / Compose:** mount a volume at `/data` (the image default). The provided
  `docker-compose.yml` already does this.
- **Railway:** attach a Volume and set `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_DIR` to its mount path;
  without a Volume the filesystem is ephemeral and links vanish on redeploy. If the
  process runs as nonroot (e.g. deploying the Docker image as-is) and writes to the
  Volume fail with a permission error, also set `RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0` — Railway mounts
  Volumes as root, so a nonroot process otherwise can't write to them.

A background sweep actively deletes entries older than `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_TTL_SECONDS`
(bucketed by creation time), so the store self-drains and disk use stays bounded by the
arrival rate over the TTL window. The sweep never deletes an entry younger than the TTL,
so `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_TTL_SECONDS` remains a true `Cache-Control` floor guarantee rather
than a hard storage lifetime. As a hard backstop against being filled within that window,
`FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_BYTES` (default 512 MiB) and `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_ENTRIES`
(default 100k) cap aggregate bytes and entry count; an over-cap create runs an inline
sweep and, if still full, returns `503` (recovering on the next sweep). These aggregate
caps were briefly removed in the previous release and are reintroduced here with durable
TTL-based eviction, so the default behaviour changed from unbounded to 512 MiB / 100k
entries. The old `FULGUR_SHORTLINK_LIMIT` env is now a startup rename-error pointing to
`FULGUR_SHORTLINK_MAX_ENTRIES`.
